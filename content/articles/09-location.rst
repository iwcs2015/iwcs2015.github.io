Conference Venue
================

The conference and workshops will take place in the **Bancroft

Theatre on the first floor (in UK terms, i.e. one floor above the ground

    staffed 24 hours a day, but please try to arrive after 12 noon to ensure that
    your room is ready (when you leave, checkout is 10am). Both Feilden and France

Getting around
==============

There are several options for eating and having a drink near Queen Mary.

On the Mile End Road, towards and close to the Mile End underground station,
there is a plethora of cafés and fast food places, e.g. Starbucks, Costa and
Nandos. There is also an Indian buffet and a sit down Chinese restaurant. From
the places close to the Stepney Green underground station, Pride of Asia stands
out, which is also an Indian buffet.

The cheapest pub option is the The Half Moon on Mile End Road and close to
Stepney Green Station. Nearby is the more expensive but good quality Italian
restaurant `Verdi <http://www.gverdi.uk/>`_ (237 Mile End Road). Orthogonal to
Mile End Road, just before the underground station, on Midlothian Road, there is
the reasonably priced Afghan/Persian restaurant `Ariana <http://www.ariana-
restaurant.co.uk/index.html>`_ (2 Midlothian Road, London E3 4SE); also
orthogonal to Mile End Road, on Grove Road, there is `The Greedy Cow
<http://greedycow.com/>`_ (2 Grove Road, London E3 5AX), with a popular range
burgers from different sources; down the Grove Road, there is a lovely coffee
shop `The Coffee room <https://www.facebook.com/thecoffeeroom.london>`_. Close
to Mile End station there is the gastro-style pub `The Morgan Arms
<http://www.morganarmsbow.com>`_ (43 Morgan St Bow, London E3 5AA). The Palm
Tree in the Mile End Park is a cosy and traditional East End pub (but beware it
only takes cash). Some other places are shown on the map.

If you're looking for the Indian/Bangladeshi food for which the area is famous,
there are many options on Brick Lane a little further west (get a bus or tube to
Aldgate East or Whitechapel station), but they can be hit-and-miss; we recommend
`Tayyabs <http://www.tayyabs.co.uk/>`_ and the `Lahore Kebab House
<http://www.lahore-kebabhouse.com/>`_ nearby more highly.

Conference Dinner
=================

The conference dinner includes a Thames boat trip and is included as part of the
registration fee.

.. The trip lasts 4 hours: we leave from Embankment Pier in
    central London at 19:00 on Friday evening, and will go east to Greenwich and the
    Thames Barrier, and west to the Houses of Parliament.

..    The boat is called the Hurlingham (run by Thames Cruises): you need to get to
    Embankment Pier (see map below) by 19:00 to get on board. We will return to the
    same place at 23:00.

..    The easiest way to get to Embankment from the conference venue is via
    Underground: just take the District Line westbound from Stepney Green station to
    Embankment station (9 stops, which should take about 20 minutes).

Walking Tour
============

Queen Mary is situated in a historic part of London's East End. If you're
interested in exploring it, we offer a self-guided audio tour together with map
and expert commentary. It takes about an hour to complete, and you can `download
it free here`__. Highlights include:

* Whitechapel murder scene of Jack the Ripper
* East End's Speakers Corner (Mile End Waste)
* Petticoat Lane Market
* Christ Church, Spitalfields
* Brick Lane

Internet Access
===============

Wireless internet access will be available at the conference venue itself;
details on how to connect will be available closer to the time. However, QMUL
supports `eduroam <https://www.eduroam.org/>`_, so if you are a member of a
participating institution, you won't have to do anything - it'll just connect
without any extra setup. We highly recommend setting up to use this if you can
(mainly because it's so useful and works in so many places)!

You should make sure that you have eduroam working at your institution before
leaving, though - it can be a bit tricky to set up initially (there's no
software to install, but you do need to tinker with security certificates). Just
ask your local IT people: it'll be worth it - you'll be able to connect anywhere
that supports eduroam.

Getting Here
============
