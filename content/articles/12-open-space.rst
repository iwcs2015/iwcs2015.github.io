Open Space / Unconference
=========================

Following a successful session at `IWCS 2013
<http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/iwcs2013/>`_, we plan to set most of Thursday
afternoon aside for an Open Space workshop (aka "unconference"). The goal of
this event is to allow participants to discuss any topic in computational
semantics they are passionate about, in small groups of people who care about
the same topic. Open Space events are self-organized: topics are proposed by
participants, sessions are run by participants, and all the conference
organizers do is facilitate the process.

The Open Space event will be structured as follows:

* On Thursday at 15:00, we'll meet in the David Sizer Lecture Theatre (ground
  floor, behind the registration desk). After a brief introduction to the Open
  Space format, anyone can get up and propose a topic for a session that they
  would like to happen that afternoon. This topic can be anything you like; it
  could be as specific as your favorite theory of scope ambiguity, as general as
  how to reconcile logic-based and distributional semantics, or even something
  that usually has no place at conferences (computational semantics education?
  ideas for shared tasks?). The only requirement is that you would enjoy talking
  about this topic.

* Sessions will be organized into time slots that start at 15:45, 16:30 and
  17:15. During each time slot, everyone who is interested in a topic is welcome
  to join the session. The crucial rule we will follow is the "Law of Two Feet":
  If you find that you are not learning anything and not contributing anything,
  you are encouraged to get up and leave the room. In this particular context,
  this is not a sign of impoliteness; it is a way of maximizing the time you're
  spending in a place that you enjoy, and of ensuring that everyone who remains
  in the session can be certain that everyone who is there is having a good
  time.

* Throughout the afternoon, we will keep a coffee break area open. If there is
  no session going on that you find interesting, you are welcome to hang out in
  the coffee corner. If you left your session, you can go there to refresh
  yourself, and perhaps join some other session. The key goal is that you enjoy
  yourself and feel that you're participating in discussions that you care
  about. Whether these happen in your original session, or some other session
  that you join, or just while you're hanging out having coffee -- that's all
  good.

* The final sessions will need to finish promptly at 18:00 -- we'll need to
  set off for central London to catch the boat for dinner.

* We will set up a public Wiki for use during the conference. You are welcome
  and encouraged to take a few minutes at the end of your session to summarize
  it in a Wiki article. If you feel uncomfortable sharing your discussion, you
  are of course not required to do this. After the conference, we will take the
  Wiki offline and distribute a reader with all articles to all participants.
