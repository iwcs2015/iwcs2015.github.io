    <!-- :news_headline: Hackathon announcement -->
<p>This year, IWCS will feature a <strong>Computational Semantics Hackathon</strong>, immediately
after the main conference on <strong>April 18th-19th</strong>.</p>
<p>We invite researchers, developers, students and users of semantic NLP tools to
participate. The goal of the event is to provide an opportunity to discuss and
develop tools that are used in Computational Semantics. Moreover, we also would
like to attract anyone interested in data processing tools so they could
contribute to open source projects represented at the event.</p>
<p>The hackathon is organised by the Computational Linguistics lab at QMUL and
sponsored by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">EPSRC</a> grant <a class="reference external" href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/J002607/1">EP/J002607/1 -- Foundational Structures for
Compositional Meaning</a>.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Project ideas</a></h2>
<p>Participants and sponsors are welcome to propose any and all ideas relating to
computational semantics - please <a class="reference external" href="mailto:d.milajevs@qmul.ac.uk?subject=IWCS-Hackathon">get in touch</a>! The list below shows some
possibilities:</p>
<div class="section" id="tweet-paraphrase-generator">

<p>Given a tweet, the system has to come up with a paraphrase. For example, by
substituting all the content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) with
similar words.</p>
<p>A twitter bot should monitor Twitter for tweets that contain <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23iwcs">#iwcs</a> and generate a paraphrase tweet. Also,
tweets directed to the bot should be replied with a paraphrase.</p>

<p>IWCS is the International Conference in Computational Semantics series: the bi-yearly
meeting of SIGSEM, the ACL special interest group on semantics. The areas
of interest for the conference include all computational aspects of meaning of
natural language within written, spoken, or multimodal communication. We are
organising the 11th IWCS conference; this will be held in Queen Mary University
of London on April 14-17th 2015. For more info see <a class="reference external" href="http://sigsem.org/iwcs2015">http://sigsem.org/iwcs2015</a>.</p>
<p>This year we would like to organize a hackathon right after the conference on
April 18th-19th. The goal of the event is to provide an opportunity to
discuss and develop tools that are used in Computational Semantics. Moreover, we
also would like to attract anyone interested in data processing tools so they
could contribute to open source projects represented at the event. Currently, we
are looking for sponsors to support the event. We aim to invite core developers
of relevant open source projects (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/">scikit- learn</a>) and provide travel grants to
everyone interested to attend the event.</p>
<p>We are also looking for experienced developers who can mentor participants and
assist with software engineering tools (version control systems, editor,
development environment set up and so on).</p>
<p>To support the event you could:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Provide funding to cover catering, traveling and organisational costs.</li>
<li>Propose project ideas that might be implemented during the hackathon.</li>
<li>Invite experienced developers to mentor.</li>
<li>Share relevant datasets.</li>

<p>ISA-11 is the eleventh edition of a series of joint workshops of the
ACL Special Interest Group in Semantics (SIGSEM) and the International
Organization of Standards ISO. ISA-workshops bring together experts in
the annotation of semantic information as expressed in text, speech,
gestures, graphics, video, images, and in communicative behaviour
where multiple modalities are combined. Examples of semantic
annotation include the markup of events, time, space, dialogue acts,
discourse relations, semantic roles, coreference and named entities,
for which the ISO organization pursues the establishment of annotation
standards in order to support the creation of interoperable semantic
resources.</p>

<p>The notion of modality involves a spectrum of phenomena that are
pervasive in language but far from being formalised. For an exhaustive
formalisation, a joint effort by computational, corpus, and formal
linguists as well as language typologists is required. The main aim of
this workshop is bringing together researchers from such fields,
towards the development of shared, stable annotation standards.</p>
<p>Beside the contribution of peer-reviewed research papers, we envisage
a truly hands-on event as part of this workshop, where we would like
to encourage participants to possibly try each other's annotation
tools and schemes, and set up a roadmap for reaching shared standards
in the annotation of modality.</p>

<p>With the growing importance of Semantic Web technologies, formal
ontologies are increasingly used by people with limited or no
background in formal logic, creating a significant interest in natural
and easily accessible front ends. In addition, the role of ontologies
in computational linguistics is recognised as crucial. Global interest
in these topics is witnessed by recent projects such as NeOn
(Lifecycle Support for Networked Ontologies), LEGO (Lexicon
Enhancement via the GOLD Ontology), SWAT (Semantic Web Authoring
Tool), PESCaDO (Personalized Environmental Service Configuration and
Delivery Orchestration), CO-ODE, and WhatIf (What if... questions for
Ontology Authoring).</p>
<p>This workshop aims to create a forum for the many ways in which
research on ontologies and research in computational linguistics
relate to each other. It aims at bringing together researchers from
different communities, including controlled languages and natural
language interfaces as well as ontology languages and linguistic
ontologies, in order to identify common interests, exploit synergies,
and share methods, tools and resources.</p>

<p>Despite being the mainstay of our language experience, the data of
conversational dialogue pose very considerable challenges for semantic
modelling.  They violate expectations provided by standard frameworks,
with apparently incomplete and/or highly context-dependent fragments
widespread. Conventional grammar frameworks are poorly set up to
reflect these dynamics, but the goal of defining models able to
reflect them is an active research area.  However, dialogue phenomena
and data provide us with evidence about intended and understood
meaning which can help define more suitable approaches, either through
inspection or through computational methods (especially given the
recent progress in distributional and inferential methods for deriving
semantic representations and parsers from context). This workshop
brings together researchers addressing these issues and assesses the
significance of this ongoing work both for approaches to semantics and
for computational modelling.</p>

<p>Distributional semantics is based on the idea that words that often
occur in the same context have similar meanings; this idea is
formalised using vector spaces and reasoned about using linear
algebra and statistical methods. In such models, basis vectors are
contexts and vectors represent meanings of words. Various distance
measures between the word vectors (e.g. geometric and Euclidean) are
used to reason about word similarity. Recently there has been a lot
of focus on a number of extensions: integrating machine learning
techniques (e.g. neural networks) to improve vector estimation;
compositionality of phrases and sentences; extended experimental
tasks; and extended mathematical models and algorithms. This workshop
aims to bring together researchers of the field who have answers for
the above questions, who have either advanced experience with the
experimental side of the field, or have worked on the more complex
composition operators, their ramifications, and the optimisation
techniques that would help implement them.</p>
