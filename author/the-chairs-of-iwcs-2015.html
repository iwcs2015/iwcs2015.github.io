<p><strong>Semantics of Language Grounding</strong></p>
<p>In this talk, I will address the problem of natural language grounding. We
assume access to natural language documents that specify the desired behavior of
a control application. Our goal is to generate a program that will perform the
task based on this description. The programs involve everything from changing
the privacy settings on your browser, playing computer games, performing complex
text processing tasks, to even solving math problems. Learning to perform tasks
like these is complicated because the space of possible programs is very large,
and the connections between the natural language and the resulting programs can
be complex and ambiguous.  I will present methods that utilize semantics of the
target domain to reduce natural language ambiguity.  On the most basic level,
executing the induced programs in the corresponding environment and observing
their effects can be used to verify the validity of the mapping from language to
programs.  We leverage this validation process as the main source of supervision
to guide learning in settings where standard supervised techniques are not
applicable. Beyond validation feedback, we demonstrate that using semantic
inference in the target domain (e.g., program equivalence) can further improve
the accuracy of natural language understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Deep Learning of Semantic Representations</strong></p>
<p>The core ingredient of deep learning is the notion of distributed
representation. This talk will start by explaining its theoretical advantages,
in comparison with non-parametric methods based on counting frequencies of
occurrence of observed tuples of values (like with n-grams). The talk will then
explain how having multiple levels of representation, i.e., depth, can in
principle give another exponential advantage. Neural language models have been
extremely successful in recent years but extending their reach from language
modelling to machine translation is very appealing because it forces the learned
intermediate representations to capture meaning, and we found that the resulting
word embeddings are qualitatively different. Recently, we introduced the notion
of attention-based neural machine translation, with impressive results on
several language pairs, and these results will conclude the talk.</p>

    </h1>

    <p>This year, IWCS will feature a <strong>Computational Semantics Hackathon</strong>, before the
main conference on <strong>April 11th-12th</strong> from 10:00 to 17:00.</p>
<p>We invite researchers, developers, students and users of semantic NLP tools to
participate. The goal of the event is to provide an opportunity to discuss and
develop tools that are used in Computational Semantics. Moreover, we also would
like to attract anyone interested in data processing tools so they could
contribute to open source projects represented at the event. <em>You don't need to
attend the conference to be able to participate at the hackathon.</em> Registration
to the hackathon will be opened soon.</p>
<p>The event will take place at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.qmsu.org/ground/">Ground Cafe</a>. It's
building 33 on the <a class="reference external" href="http://iwcs2015.github.io/static/qm-campus-map.pdf">QMUL campus map</a>.
Please refer to the <a class="reference external" href="http://iwcs2015.github.io/location.html">location page</a> for
more information on how to get to the QMUL Mile End Campus.</p>
<p>The hackathon is organised by the Computational Linguistics lab at QMUL and
sponsored by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/">EPSRC</a> grant <a class="reference external" href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/J002607/1">EP/J002607/1 — Foundational Structures for

<p>Participants and sponsors are welcome to propose any and all ideas relating to
computational semantics - please <a class="reference external" href="mailto:d.milajevs@qmul.ac.uk?subject=IWCS-Hackathon">get in touch</a> or submit a pull request with
your idea added to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/iwcs2015/iwcs2015.github.io/blob/pelican/content/articles/07-hackathon.rst">this page</a>! The list below shows some possibilities:</p>
<div class="section" id="tweet-paraphrase-generator">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Tweet paraphrase generator</a></h3>
<p>Given a tweet, the system has to come up with a paraphrase. For example, by
substituting all the content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) with
similar words.</p>
<p>A twitter bot should monitor Twitter for tweets that contain <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23iwcs">#iwcs</a> and generate a paraphrase tweet. Also,
tweets directed to the bot should be replied with a paraphrase.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">NLTK corpus readers</a></h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a> is a natural language toolkit that provides basic tools to deal with
textual information. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.corpus.reader.html#module-nltk.corpus.reader">Corpus readers</a> are interfaces to access textual resources
(called corpora). The task is to provide interfaces to the following resources.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Groningen Meaning Bank</strong>: the <a class="reference external" href="http://gmb.let.rug.nl/">Groningen Meaning Bank</a> is a free
semantically annotated corpus that anyone can edit.</li>
<li><strong>UkWaC</strong>: <a class="reference external" href="http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/doku.php">UkWaC</a> is a 2 billion word corpus constructed from the Web
limiting the crawl to the .uk domain.</li>
<li><strong>Wikipedia</strong>: Wikipedia provides <a class="reference external" href="https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/">dumps</a> of all its content. However, to be
used as a corpus a dump has to be cleaned up from the wiki markup. There are
at least two ways of getting raw text out of a Wikipedia dump. Wiki markup can
be filtered out using regular expressions, as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/corpora/wikicorpus.py">it's done</a> in <a class="reference external" href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">gensim</a>.
Alternatively, text in the wiki markup can be parsed using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid">Parsoid</a> to
obtain (X)HTML, later this HTML is processed, for example tables and images
are removed. See <a class="reference external" href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/dimazest/phd-buildout/raw/tip/notebooks/Wikipedia%20dump.ipynb">this notebook</a>.</li>
<li><strong>AMR</strong>: the <a class="reference external" href="http://amr.isi.edu/index.html">AMR Bank</a> is a set of English sentences paired with simple,
readable semantic representations.</li>

<div class="section" id="a-distributional-semantic-toolkit">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">A distributional semantic toolkit</a></h3>
<p>This project aims to provide researchers working in distributional semantics with
a set of core Python utilities. The following functionality is required:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A space-efficient datastructure for storing distributed representations of words
and phrases, e.g. through memory-mapped <cite>numpy</cite> arrays or <cite>bcolz</cite>-backed <cite>pandas</cite> data frames</li>
<li>Efficient exact and approximate nearest neighbour search, e.g. through a <cite>scikit-learn</cite>'s
KD-tree or random projections</li>
<li>Efficient dimensionality reduction (SVD, NMF) and feature reweighting (PMI, PPMI)</li>
<li>Converters to and from commonly used formats</li>
<li>Easy evaluation against a set of word similarity datasets, such as Mitchel and Lapata (2008) or MEN</li>
</ul>
<p>The project will involve merging and documenting existing pieces of software, such as
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/composes-toolkit/dissect">DISSECT</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dimazest/fowler.corpora">foller.corpora</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MLCL/DiscoUtils">discoutils</a>.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Conference Dinner</a></h2>
<p>The conference dinner includes a Thames boat trip and is included as part of the
registration fee.</p>
<!-- The trip lasts 4 hours: we leave from Embankment Pier in
central London at 19:00 on Friday evening, and will go east to Greenwich and the
Thames Barrier, and west to the Houses of Parliament. -->
<!-- The boat is called the Hurlingham (run by Thames Cruises): you need to get to
Embankment Pier (see map below) by 19:00 to get on board. We will return to the
same place at 23:00. -->
<!-- The easiest way to get to Embankment from the conference venue is via
Underground: just take the District Line westbound from Stepney Green station to
Embankment station (9 stops, which should take about 20 minutes). -->

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Internet Access</a></h2>
<p>Wireless internet access will be available at the conference venue itself;
details on how to connect will be available closer to the time. However, QMUL
supports <a class="reference external" href="https://www.eduroam.org/">eduroam</a>, so if you are a member of a
participating institution, you won't have to do anything - it'll just connect
without any extra setup. We highly recommend setting up to use this if you can
(mainly because it's so useful and works in so many places)!</p>
<p>You should make sure that you have eduroam working at your institution before
leaving, though - it can be a bit tricky to set up initially (there's no
software to install, but you do need to tinker with security certificates). Just
ask your local IT people: it'll be worth it - you'll be able to connect anywhere
that supports eduroam.</p>

<div class="section" id="getting-here">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Getting Here</a></h2>

and how to get there</a>, and for <a class="reference external" href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/docs/about/26065.pdf">a full campus map</a>.</p>
<p>The nearest Underground stations are Mile End (Central, District and Hammersmith
&amp; City lines) and Stepney Green (District and Hammersmith &amp; City), each about 5
minutes walk away. Central London is very close: Liverpool Street station is
only two stops on the Central Line (5 mins) from Mile End.</p>
<p>Trains from Paris and the continent arrive at St Pancras; from there it's 20-25
minutes on the Underground. Trains from elsewhere in the UK could arrive almost
anywhere, but for airport train information see below.</p>
<p>The number 25 bus (Oxford Circus to Ilford - see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/bus/route/25/">here</a> for a route map) travels along Mile End
Road at five to ten minute intervals throughout the day, and stops outside the
College.</p>

where multiple modalities are combined. Examples of semantic
annotation include the markup of events, time, space, dialogue acts,
discourse relations, semantic roles, coreference and named entities,
for which the ISO organization pursues the establishment of annotation
standards in order to support the creation of interoperable semantic
resources.</p>

<p>The notion of modality involves a spectrum of phenomena that are
pervasive in language but far from being formalised. For an exhaustive
formalisation, a joint effort by computational, corpus, and formal
linguists as well as language typologists is required. The main aim of
this workshop is bringing together researchers from such fields,
towards the development of shared, stable annotation standards.</p>
<p>Beside the contribution of peer-reviewed research papers, we envisage
a truly hands-on event as part of this workshop, where we would like
to encourage participants to possibly try each other's annotation
tools and schemes, and set up a roadmap for reaching shared standards
in the annotation of modality.</p>

<p>With the growing importance of Semantic Web technologies, formal
ontologies are increasingly used by people with limited or no
background in formal logic, creating a significant interest in natural
and easily accessible front ends. In addition, the role of ontologies
in computational linguistics is recognised as crucial. Global interest
in these topics is witnessed by recent projects such as NeOn
(Lifecycle Support for Networked Ontologies), LEGO (Lexicon
Enhancement via the GOLD Ontology), SWAT (Semantic Web Authoring
Tool), PESCaDO (Personalized Environmental Service Configuration and
Delivery Orchestration), CO-ODE, and WhatIf (What if... questions for
Ontology Authoring).</p>
<p>This workshop aims to create a forum for the many ways in which
research on ontologies and research in computational linguistics
relate to each other. It aims at bringing together researchers from
different communities, including controlled languages and natural
language interfaces as well as ontology languages and linguistic
ontologies, in order to identify common interests, exploit synergies,
and share methods, tools and resources.</p>

<p>Despite being the mainstay of our language experience, the data of
conversational dialogue pose very considerable challenges for semantic
modelling.  They violate expectations provided by standard frameworks,
with apparently incomplete and/or highly context-dependent fragments
widespread. Conventional grammar frameworks are poorly set up to
reflect these dynamics, but the goal of defining models able to
reflect them is an active research area.  However, dialogue phenomena
and data provide us with evidence about intended and understood
meaning which can help define more suitable approaches, either through
inspection or through computational methods (especially given the
recent progress in distributional and inferential methods for deriving
semantic representations and parsers from context). This workshop
brings together researchers addressing these issues and assesses the
significance of this ongoing work both for approaches to semantics and
for computational modelling.</p>

<p>Distributional semantics is based on the idea that words that often
occur in the same context have similar meanings; this idea is
formalised using vector spaces and reasoned about using linear
algebra and statistical methods. In such models, basis vectors are
contexts and vectors represent meanings of words. Various distance
measures between the word vectors (e.g. geometric and Euclidean) are
used to reason about word similarity. Recently there has been a lot
of focus on a number of extensions: integrating machine learning
techniques (e.g. neural networks) to improve vector estimation;
compositionality of phrases and sentences; extended experimental
tasks; and extended mathematical models and algorithms. This workshop
aims to bring together researchers of the field who have answers for
the above questions, who have either advanced experience with the
experimental side of the field, or have worked on the more complex
composition operators, their ramifications, and the optimisation
techniques that would help implement them.</p>
