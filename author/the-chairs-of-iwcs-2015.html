<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Getting around</a></h2>
<p>There are several options for eating and having a drink near Queen Mary.</p>
<p>On the Mile End Road, towards and close to the Mile End underground station,
there is a plethora of cafés and fast food places, e.g. Starbucks, Costa and
Nandos. There is also an Indian buffet and a sit down Chinese restaurant. From
the places close to the Stepney Green underground station, Pride of Asia stands
out, which is also an Indian buffet.</p>
<p>The cheapest pub option is the The Half Moon on Mile End Road and close to
Stepney Green Station. Nearby is the more expensive but good quality Italian
restaurant <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gverdi.uk/">Verdi</a> (237 Mile End Road). Orthogonal to
Mile End Road, just before the underground station, on Midlothian Road, there is
the reasonably priced Afghan/Persian restaurant <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ariana-restaurant.co.uk/index.html">Ariana</a> (2 Midlothian Road, London E3 4SE); also
orthogonal to Mile End Road, on Grove Road, there is <a class="reference external" href="http://greedycow.com/">The Greedy Cow</a> (2 Grove Road, London E3 5AX), with a popular range
burgers from different sources; down the Grove Road, there is a lovely coffee
shop <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/thecoffeeroom.london">The Coffee room</a>. Close
to Mile End station there is the gastro-style pub <a class="reference external" href="http://www.morganarmsbow.com">The Morgan Arms</a> (43 Morgan St Bow, London E3 5AA). The Palm
Tree in the Mile End Park is a cosy and traditional East End pub (but beware it
only takes cash). Some other places are shown on the map.</p>
<p>If you're looking for the Indian/Bangladeshi food for which the area is famous,
there are many options on Brick Lane a little further west (get a bus or tube to
Aldgate East or Whitechapel station), but they can be hit-and-miss; we recommend
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.tayyabs.co.uk/">Tayyabs</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lahore-kebabhouse.com/">Lahore Kebab House</a> nearby more highly.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Conference Dinner</a></h2>
<p>The conference dinner includes a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.thamescruises.com">Thames boat
trip</a> and is included as part of the registration
fee. The boat is called Thames Princess. We embark on Lambeth Pier. To get
there, take a District line train to Westmister, walk over Westminster Bridge
and turn right along the river (away from the London Eye). It’s a 5-10 minute
walk before you reach Lambeth Pier, which is just by Lambeth Bridge.</p>
<!-- The trip lasts 4 hours: we leave from Embankment Pier in
central London at 19:00 on Friday evening, and will go east to Greenwich and the
Thames Barrier, and west to the Houses of Parliament. -->
<!-- The boat is called the Hurlingham (run by Thames Cruises): you need to get to
Embankment Pier (see map below) by 19:00 to get on board. We will return to the
same place at 23:00. -->
<!-- The easiest way to get to Embankment from the conference venue is via
Underground: just take the District Line westbound from Stepney Green station to
Embankment station (9 stops, which should take about 20 minutes). -->

<p>Wireless internet access will be available at the conference venue itself;

supports <a class="reference external" href="https://www.eduroam.org/">eduroam</a>, so if you are a member of a
participating institution, you won't have to do anything - it'll just connect
without any extra setup. We highly recommend setting up to use this if you can
(mainly because it's so useful and works in so many places)!</p>
<p>You should make sure that you have eduroam working at your institution before
leaving, though - it can be a bit tricky to set up initially (there's no
software to install, but you do need to tinker with security certificates). Just
ask your local IT people: it'll be worth it - you'll be able to connect anywhere
that supports eduroam.</p>

<h2>Open Space / Unconference</h2>
<p>Following a successful session at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/iwcs2013/">IWCS 2013</a>, we plan to set most of Thursday
afternoon aside for an Open Space workshop (aka &quot;unconference&quot;). The goal of
this event is to allow participants to discuss any topic in computational
semantics they are passionate about, in small groups of people who care about
the same topic. Open Space events are self-organized: topics are proposed by
participants, sessions are run by participants, and all the conference
organizers do is facilitate the process.</p>
<p>The Open Space event will be structured as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On Thursday at 15:00, we'll meet in the coffee/poster room. After a brief
introduction to the Open Space format, anyone can get up and propose a topic
for a session that they would like to happen that afternoon. This topic can be
anything you like; it could be as specific as your favorite theory of scope
ambiguity, as general as how to reconcile logic-based and distributional
semantics, or even something that usually has no place at conferences
(computational semantics education? ideas for shared tasks?). The only
requirement is that you would enjoy talking about this topic.</li>
<li>Sessions will be organized into time slots that start at 15:30 and
16:30. During that time slot, everyone who is interested in a topic is welcome
to join the session. The crucial rule we will follow is the &quot;Law of Two Feet&quot;:
If you find that you are not learning anything and not contributing anything,
you are encouraged to get up and leave the room. In this particular context,
this is not a sign of impoliteness; it is a way of maximizing the time you're
spending in a place that you enjoy, and of ensuring that everyone who remains
in the session can be certain that everyone who is there is having a good
time.</li>
<li>Throughout the afternoon, we will keep a coffee break area open. If there is
no session going on that you find interesting, you are welcome to hang out in
the coffee corner. If you left your session, you can go there to refresh
yourself, and perhaps join some other session. The key goal is that you enjoy
yourself and feel that you're participating in discussions that you care
about. Whether these happen in your original session, or some other session
that you join, or just while you're hanging out having coffee -- that's all
good.</li>
<li>We will rejoin for a final session at 17:30 to give everyone a chance to talk
about things they learned that day. When we're done with that, we'll need to
set off for central London to catch the boat for dinner.</li>
<li>We will set up a public Wiki for use during the conference. You are welcome
and encouraged to take a few minutes at the end of your session to summarize
it in a Wiki article. If you feel uncomfortable sharing your discussion, you
are of course not required to do this. After the conference, we will take the
Wiki offline and distribute a reader with all articles to all participants.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information on Open Space in general in its <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">Wikipedia page</a> and in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.openspaceworld.com/users_guide.htm">Open Space

<p><strong>Semantics of Language Grounding</strong></p>
<p>In this talk, I will address the problem of natural language grounding. We
assume access to natural language documents that specify the desired behavior of
a control application. Our goal is to generate a program that will perform the
task based on this description. The programs involve everything from changing
the privacy settings on your browser, playing computer games, performing complex
text processing tasks, to even solving math problems. Learning to perform tasks
like these is complicated because the space of possible programs is very large,
and the connections between the natural language and the resulting programs can
be complex and ambiguous.  I will present methods that utilize semantics of the
target domain to reduce natural language ambiguity.  On the most basic level,
executing the induced programs in the corresponding environment and observing
their effects can be used to verify the validity of the mapping from language to
programs.  We leverage this validation process as the main source of supervision
to guide learning in settings where standard supervised techniques are not
applicable. Beyond validation feedback, we demonstrate that using semantic
inference in the target domain (e.g., program equivalence) can further improve
the accuracy of natural language understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Deep Learning of Semantic Representations</strong></p>
<p>The core ingredient of deep learning is the notion of distributed
representation. This talk will start by explaining its theoretical advantages,
in comparison with non-parametric methods based on counting frequencies of
occurrence of observed tuples of values (like with n-grams). The talk will then
explain how having multiple levels of representation, i.e., depth, can in
principle give another exponential advantage. Neural language models have been
extremely successful in recent years but extending their reach from language
modelling to machine translation is very appealing because it forces the learned
intermediate representations to capture meaning, and we found that the resulting
word embeddings are qualitatively different. Recently, we introduced the notion
of attention-based neural machine translation, with impressive results on
several language pairs, and these results will conclude the talk.</p>

<p><strong>Is There Any Logic in Logical Forms?</strong></p>
<p>Formalising the notion of compositionality in a way that makes it meaningful is
notoriously complicated. The usual way of formally describing compositional
semantics is via a version of Montague Grammar but, in many ways, MG and its
successors are inconsistent with the way semantics is used in computational
linguistics.  As computational linguists we are rarely interested in
model-theory or truth-conditions.  Our assumptions about word meaning, and
distributional models in particular, are very different from the MG
idealisation.  However, computational grammars have been constructed which
produce empirically useful forms of compositional representation and are much
broader in coverage than any grammar fragments from the linguistics literature.
The methodology which underlies this work is predominantly syntax-driven (e.g.,
CCG, LFG and HPSG), but the goal has been to abstract away from the
language-dependent details of syntax.  The question, then, is whether this is
'just engineering' or whether there is some theoretical basis which is more
consistent with CL than the broadly Montogovian approach.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will start by outlining some of the work on compositional
semantics with large-scale computational grammars and in particular work using
Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) in DELPH-IN.  There are grammar fragments for
which MRS can be converted into a logical form with a model-theoretic
interpretation but I will argue that attempting to use model theory to justify
the MRS structures in general is inconsistent with the goals of grammar
engineering.  I will outline some alternative approaches to integrating
distributional semantics with this framework and show that this also causes
theoretical difficulties.  In both cases, we could consider inferentialism as an
alternative theoretical grounding whereby classical logical properties are
treated as secondary rather than primary. In this view, it is important that our
approaches to compositional and lexical semantics are consistent with uses of
language in logical reasoning, but it is not necessary to try and reduce all
aspects of semantics to logic.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>A space-efficient datastructure for storing distributed representations of words
and phrases, e.g. through memory-mapped <cite>numpy</cite> arrays or <cite>bcolz</cite>-backed <cite>pandas</cite> data frames</li>
<li>Efficient exact and approximate nearest neighbour search, e.g. through a <cite>scikit-learn</cite>'s
KD-tree or random projections</li>
<li>Efficient dimensionality reduction (SVD, NMF) and feature reweighting (PMI, PPMI)</li>
<li>Converters to and from commonly used formats</li>
<li>Easy evaluation against a set of word similarity datasets, such as Mitchel and Lapata (2008) or MEN</li>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Compositionality for distributional semantic toolkits (Yellow)</a></h3>
<p>It has been shown that some type-logical grammars can be interpreted in vector

such a grammar to a distributional setting.</p>
<p>Ingredients are a representation of such grammars in terms of a
lexicon/derivation rules, a suitable interpretation of types and proofs into
tensor spaces and maps, and distributional data.</p>
<p>Given a lexicon and derivational rules, a theorem prover such as <a class="reference external" href="http://rise4fun.com/z3">z3</a> provides a
proof for a given input sentence which is later used to obtain distributional
representation.</p>

<p>The goal of this task is to come up with a easy to deploy and well documented
pipeline of processing a Wikipdedia dump. There are two steps in the pipeline:
raw text extraction and parsing.</p>
<p>There are at least two ways of getting raw text out of a Wikipedia dump. Wiki
markup can be filtered out using regular expressions, as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim/blob/develop/gensim/corpora/wikicorpus.py">it's done</a> in
<a class="reference external" href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/">gensim</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bwbaugh/wikipedia-extractor">Wikipedia Extractor</a>. Alternatively, text in the wiki markup can
be parsed using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid">Parsoid</a> to obtain (X)HTML, later this HTML is processed, for
example tables and images are removed (see <a class="reference external" href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/dimazest/phd-buildout/raw/tip/notebooks/Wikipedia%20dump.ipynb">this notebook</a>). <a class="reference external" href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/docverter/docverter#docverter-server">Docverter</a> is a powerful document conversion solution that can be used to
convert a wiki dump to plain text.</p>
<p>Later the raw text of a dump can be parsed by some of these parsers:</p>

<p>ISA-11 is the eleventh edition of a series of joint workshops of the
ACL Special Interest Group in Semantics (SIGSEM) and the International
Organization of Standards ISO. ISA-workshops bring together experts in
the annotation of semantic information as expressed in text, speech,
gestures, graphics, video, images, and in communicative behaviour
where multiple modalities are combined. Examples of semantic
annotation include the markup of events, time, space, dialogue acts,
discourse relations, semantic roles, coreference and named entities,
for which the ISO organization pursues the establishment of annotation
standards in order to support the creation of interoperable semantic
resources.</p>

<p>The notion of modality involves a spectrum of phenomena that are
pervasive in language but far from being formalised. For an exhaustive
formalisation, a joint effort by computational, corpus, and formal
linguists as well as language typologists is required. The main aim of
this workshop is bringing together researchers from such fields,
towards the development of shared, stable annotation standards.</p>
<p>Beside the contribution of peer-reviewed research papers, we envisage
a truly hands-on event as part of this workshop, where we would like
to encourage participants to possibly try each other's annotation
tools and schemes, and set up a roadmap for reaching shared standards
in the annotation of modality.</p>

<p>With the growing importance of Semantic Web technologies, formal
ontologies are increasingly used by people with limited or no
background in formal logic, creating a significant interest in natural
and easily accessible front ends. In addition, the role of ontologies
in computational linguistics is recognised as crucial. Global interest
in these topics is witnessed by recent projects such as NeOn
(Lifecycle Support for Networked Ontologies), LEGO (Lexicon
Enhancement via the GOLD Ontology), SWAT (Semantic Web Authoring
Tool), PESCaDO (Personalized Environmental Service Configuration and
Delivery Orchestration), CO-ODE, and WhatIf (What if... questions for
Ontology Authoring).</p>
<p>This workshop aims to create a forum for the many ways in which
research on ontologies and research in computational linguistics
relate to each other. It aims at bringing together researchers from
different communities, including controlled languages and natural
language interfaces as well as ontology languages and linguistic
ontologies, in order to identify common interests, exploit synergies,
and share methods, tools and resources.</p>

<p>Despite being the mainstay of our language experience, the data of
conversational dialogue pose very considerable challenges for semantic
modelling.  They violate expectations provided by standard frameworks,
with apparently incomplete and/or highly context-dependent fragments
widespread. Conventional grammar frameworks are poorly set up to
reflect these dynamics, but the goal of defining models able to
reflect them is an active research area.  However, dialogue phenomena
and data provide us with evidence about intended and understood
meaning which can help define more suitable approaches, either through
inspection or through computational methods (especially given the
recent progress in distributional and inferential methods for deriving
semantic representations and parsers from context). This workshop
brings together researchers addressing these issues and assesses the
significance of this ongoing work both for approaches to semantics and
for computational modelling.</p>

<p>Distributional semantics is based on the idea that words that often
occur in the same context have similar meanings; this idea is
formalised using vector spaces and reasoned about using linear
algebra and statistical methods. In such models, basis vectors are
contexts and vectors represent meanings of words. Various distance
measures between the word vectors (e.g. geometric and Euclidean) are
used to reason about word similarity. Recently there has been a lot
of focus on a number of extensions: integrating machine learning
techniques (e.g. neural networks) to improve vector estimation;
compositionality of phrases and sentences; extended experimental
tasks; and extended mathematical models and algorithms. This workshop
aims to bring together researchers of the field who have answers for
the above questions, who have either advanced experience with the
experimental side of the field, or have worked on the more complex
composition operators, their ramifications, and the optimisation
techniques that would help implement them.</p>
